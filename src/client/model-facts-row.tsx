/**
 * The one row of per-model facts, shared by all three pages.
 *
 * ## Why one component
 *
 * A model can be seen in three places — the sign-in page, the aggregate lane
 * and the account pool — and these used to be three independent renderings of
 * the same underlying numbers. That is not a duplication problem, it is a
 * truthfulness problem: when the pool lane reported a live 128K window and the
 * aggregate lane printed the registry's absent value, the same model looked
 * like two different models, and the user had no way to tell which was right.
 * Sharing the component means a fact is read in one place, so the three pages
 * cannot disagree.
 *
 * ## What it prints, and what it refuses to print
 *
 * Only what an upstream published: context window, output ceiling, whether the
 * model takes images, and the thinking levels it names. A field nobody
 * published is omitted entirely rather than filled with a plausible guess —
 * see {@link modelFactsFor} for why that rule exists. There is no inference
 * left in the printed numbers: a window is printed at the size the model
 * publishes it, because clamping it to a smaller number this module invented
 * made a 1M model read "131K" while the picker next to it offered 1M.
 *
 * The row renders nothing at all when nothing is known, which is the honest
 * outcome for the majority of registry rows: 456 of 504 carry no window, and
 * none carries vision or reasoning data.
